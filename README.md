# Model is based on scientific article of authors Billet and Schultes from 1999 which predicts mass transfer and hydraulic for dumped and arranged packings.
Tasks:
	1.  Calculation of liquid mass flow at flooding point;
	2.  Calculation of liquid mass flow at loading point;
	3.  Calculation of dry pressure drop in same script as liquid calculations;
	4.  Calculation of wet pressure drop in same script as liquid calculations;
	5.  Write library for packings.
	6.  Library - combine 1st and 2nd choice conditions
	7.  Calculation of gas mass flow at flooding point;
	8.  Calculation of gas mass flow at loading point;
	9.  Write condition for better convergation with error handling (new guess) for gas and liquid main.py;
	10. Combine gas and liquid main.py together;
	11. Create inputs for cases: 
			a) which packing and which type;
			b) calculate liquid or gass mass flow;
			c) convergation - better guess;
	12. Make code dry and clean;
	13. Start with GUI.
